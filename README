A few vectorized algorithms for rvv 0.7.1

A risc-v cross compiler + assembler supporting rvv 0.7.1 is required (other versions might be able to assemble the code, but it won't run properly)

Still to be done:
- clean up code for the DFA evalulation/replacement
- provide instructions for obtaining a working cross compiler
- find a commit of `spike` that actually supports all of rvv 0.7.1
- port to rvv 1.0
- more accurate profiling (anything that isn't gettimeofday seems to segfault on a nezha d1, even when using the official toolchain)
